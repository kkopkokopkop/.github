## 📖 About This Project

**Synapse X** is a robust scripting engine designed for power users, developers, and automation testers in the Roblox environment. As one of the most advanced Lua executors available for Windows, it offers seamless script injection, execution stability, and compatibility with modern APIs used in popular scripts and hubs.

Unlike legacy executors, Synapse X doesn’t just attach and execute—it integrates deeply into the game’s environment using native-level hooks and a refined sandbox system. This results in faster execution, improved compatibility, and a significantly lower crash/detection rate.

From executing complex GUI scripts to batch-running automated test functions, Synapse X is tailored for anyone who needs direct control and flexibility over the Roblox client. Whether you're building development tools, debugging in-game elements, or running script hubs, this tool provides the environment and power to do it safely.
